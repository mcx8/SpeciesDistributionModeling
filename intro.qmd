## About the Course

![](/images/home_banner.png)

This class is a structured practicum with the goal of supporting students to build the knowledge and skills relevant to applying data science to issues of species conservation. The class was developed collaboratively by the University of Arizona and Lewis & Clark College through the National Science Foundation's Harnessing the Data Revolution grant in 2021 (more info [here](https://github.com/BiodiversityDataScienceCorp)).

We will simulate assisting professionals at the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service who are on the front lines of managing endangered species. You will work to organize, clean, analyze and visualize data to help improve conservation approaches and management efforts for species of concern in the United States. In this process, you will be introduced to the realities of conservation jobs in government and non-profit organizations. This course is designed to help you build professional skills that are relevant in these fields and learn more about data science and best practices in project management.

***Prerequisites*****:** There are no particular course prerequisites, but it is advised that students should have had introductory experience with R programming language.

***Required Texts, Readings, and Videos*****:** Students will not have to purchase additional texts, readings, or videos for this course. All material will be available as open source material (a.k.a. free).

***Required Materials*****:** Many of the in class activities will involve a personal laptop. Necessary software is all open source (a.k.a. free).

## Module Descriptions

### ‚§ï Applications in Conservation Science üåø

This section will introduce students to the role U.S. Fish & Wildlife plays in evaluating and protecting endangered species.

-   Species Status Assessments
-   ***Assignment*****:** Perform research on your species of choice from those listed in the Environmental Conservation Online System. Write up a document describing the natural history and biology of your species. More detailed instructions here: \[link\]

### ‚§ï The Bridge Between Nature and Programming ‚å®Ô∏è

Having a place to store all the data and code we will be working with is important for ensuring everything is reproducible for others.

-   RStudio & Coding
-   Github, The Place Where Everything Goes
-   ***Assignment*****:** Set up your Github and download RStudio to your computer. Play around to get comfortable and don't forget to connect your RStudio to your Github! It will serve as both a "cloud" storage and will help keep everything you do documented (assuming you always remember to commit and push before you sign off). More detailed instructions here: \[link\]

### ‚§ï The Analysis: Species Distribution Models üåç

Here, we will guide students through the process of determining where a species has been observed by the community and how to predict its distribution based on that information.

-   Acquiring Occurrence Data (from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility)
-   Mapping Occurrence Data with `ggplot2`
-   Mapping Occurrence Data with `leaflet`
-   Predicting Current Distributions
-   Predicting Forecasted Distributions
-   ***Assignment*****:** Repeat the analysis we have done here to your own species. Make sure to create an occurrence map, plot a current distribution, and plot a forecasted distribution. More detailed instructions here: \[link\]

### ‚§ï Drawing Conclusions & Making Decisions üîé

Now that we have ample information on the natural history, biological needs, and current and forecasted distributions of our species, what does it all mean? What do the species need and what should be discussed in our Species Status Assessments?

-   ***Assignment*****:** Put all your work from previous sections together and create a Species Status Assessment for your species! Make sure to discuss the caveats and future steps you think should be taken to help protect your organism. More detailed instructions here: \[link\]

## Learning Objectives

During this course, we expect students to...

1.  Apply computational methods for handling and using data to inform questions and solve problems;
2.  Implement professional practices to produce data-informed deliverables useful for stakeholder decision making;
3.  Practice communicating insight from data through written, visual, and verbal media to a variety of audiences;
4.  Create a professional toolbox of applied data science skills useful for applications of interest and future careers;
5.  Summarize and appraise data science approaches as they relate to addressing real-world challenges.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will...

1.  Define, differentiate, and explain the nature and application of modern computational methods for handling and using data as it relates to real-world situations and challenges;¬†
2.  Associate, examine, and compare how to infer meaning and insight from data through written, visual, and verbal communication to both experts and non-experts;
3.  Summarize, implement, and appraise data analytics and their interpretation in relation to real-world circumstances;
4.  Practice, manage, and design a personal toolbox of data skills useful for various careers and professions

## Footnotes

This course is designed to be compatible for both self-directed learning and for use in classrooms.
